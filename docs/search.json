    "text": "We investigate physiological mechanisms in fish (and other animals) from a variety of habitats to characterise their resilience and vulnerability under natural and human-associated environmental change. Open-minded and joy filled whiteboard brainstorming session is one of our favorite lab activities!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcological physiology of fish across body sizes and lifestages\n\n\n As fish grow and mature, they may shift habitats, encounter new environmental stressors, and reallocate energy from growth toward reproduction. Our projects explore both acute and acclimation responses in fish and other ectotherms across body size (and life-stags) as they face a range of environmental challenges. Through this work, we aim to better understand the physiological mechanisms that drive species’ vulnerability or resilience in dynamic ecosystems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNative and invasive crayfish in urban streams\n\n\n Freshwater salinization is an emerging concern across urban landscapes, impacting stream ecosystems and aquatic life. Our current projects compare the effects of elevated salinity (NaCl) on metabolic rates in native and widely distributed invasive crayfish species in Maryland with the aim to understand better the physiological capacities that may contribute to the success of invasive species in urbanized freshwater systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcological toxicology. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aquatic systems\n\n\n PFAS, often called “forever chemicals,” are a broad class of persistent and bioaccumulative compounds found globally in water, air, soil, sediment. Exposure to PFAS can have harmful effects on the health of both animals and humans. Our research focuses on understanding PFAS bioaccumulation across food webs in wild ecosystems, where exposure varies across time and space. In the lab, we investigate the causes and consequences of PFAS uptake in fish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nCheck in soon to learn more about the upcoming collaborative projects on anemones, turtles, and tadpoles."

    "text": "Welcome to the Ecological Physiology Lab at Towson University! We explore how aquatic ectotherms—especially fish—respond to various natural and human-induced environmental stressors such as temperature fluctuations, salinity changes, hypoxia, altered flows, and toxicants.\nWe take an integrative approach, combining laboratory experiments, field studies, and quantitative techniques to examine various aspects of animal physiology, which include but are not limited to metabolic rates, cardiac performance and swimming performance. Rooted in a spirit of teamwork and cultivating a supportive environment for everyone we strive to generate insights that can inform conservation and management strategies for aquatic ecosystems.\n\n\nWe are always excited to exchange ideas and establish new connections– If you are interested in what we do and would like to join the lab - we would love to hear from you!\n\n\n Image (art) credit: Vinicius Goecks"
