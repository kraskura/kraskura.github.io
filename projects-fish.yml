    As fish grow and mature, they may shift habitats, encounter new environmental stressors, and reallocate energy from growth toward reproduction. Our projects explore both acute and acclimation responses in fish and other ectotherms across body size (and life-stags) as they face a range of environmental challenges. Through this work, we aim to better understand the physiological mechanisms that drive speciesâ€™ vulnerability or resilience in dynamic ecosystems.
