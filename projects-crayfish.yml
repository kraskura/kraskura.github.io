    Freshwater salinization is an emerging concern across urban landscapes, impacting stream ecosystems and aquatic life. Our current projects compare the effects of elevated salinity (NaCl) on metabolic rates in native and widely distributed invasive crayfish species in Maryland with the aim to understand better the physiological capacities that may contribute to the success of invasive species in urbanized freshwater systems.
