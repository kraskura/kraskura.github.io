      PFAS, often called “forever chemicals,” are a broad class of persistent and bioaccumulative compounds found globally in water, air, soil, sediment. Exposure to PFAS can have harmful effects on the health of both animals and humans. Our research focuses on understanding PFAS bioaccumulation across food webs in wild ecosystems, where exposure varies across time and space. In the lab, we investigate the causes and consequences of PFAS uptake in fish.
