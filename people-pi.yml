  description: "I am curious about how physiological mechanisms enable fish and other animals to withstand environmental challenge. I am particularlly excited to explore how organisms' physiological performance changes across body size, life-stages, and between the 'lab' and field animals. On my free time, I love to stay active, hike, stare into the water to find animals, and try new things like pottery, and gardening!"
