  description: "'I love fish! I am especially interested in temperature tolerance, blood physiology and blood cell morphology, and how climate change affects fish's performance curves. Outside of research, I dabble in many hobbies including weightlifting, video gaming, and playing guitar.'"

    Master's Student. Co-mentored with Dr. Ryan
  description: "'I am broadly interested in the effects of environmental change on populations and their ecological roles. Specifically, I am interested in how genetic connectivity, adaptation, and phenotypic plasticity influence a species' ability to adjust to the changing environment. I enjoy hiking, fishing, herping, and being outside in any capacity! I also enjoy playing the guitar when I can.'"

  subtitle: Undergraduate Student. Co-mentored with Dr. Salice
  description: "'I explore the ecological impacts of freshwater salinization in Maryland, specifically how salinity affects sex-specific metabolic performance in the native Common crayfish and the invasive Virile crayfish. My goals are to uncover the physiological mechanisms behind the success of invasive species and to contribute insights that inform future conservation and resource management strategies. More broadly, I am passionate about watershed ecology, conservation, and sustainability. I enjoy gardening, drawing and painting, and exploring the outdoorsâ€”activities that deepen my appreciation for the natural systems I study!'"
